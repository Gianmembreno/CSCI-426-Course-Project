Abstract:

  The goal of this project is to develop a Ted Talk recommender system. The system will provide recommendations based on the user's input text, which represents their interests or a specific topic they are looking for. The recommender system utilizes techniques such as cosine similarity, Pearson correlation, and BM25 scoring to calculate the similarity between the input text and the textual content of the Ted Talk dataset. The system aims to help users discover relevant and engaging talks that align with their interests and preferences. This report presents the methodology used to build the recommender system and a literature review, data description, and conclusions for future work.
